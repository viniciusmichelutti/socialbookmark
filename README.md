# Social Bookmark
Django application with social touch :-)
This is just for learning and tests purposes, so don't expect best practices and good architecture.

## Features
This is a work in progress. So, until now, you can:

* User registration
* Login / logout
* Login with Facebook
* Forget password (send confirmation email, token)
* Change password (after logged in)
* Edit profile and set image profile
* It's possible to add a bookmark to click on any page and select image to bookmark
* Like and unlike photos from users
